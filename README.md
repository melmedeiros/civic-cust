# Civic customization dictionary	
This dictionary includes the names of politicians and journalists, media outlets, cabinet positions, and advocacy/activist groups in the U.S. Also included are general keywords related to U.S. politics. 

We used this dictionary with a matching program to compare the lists of pages individuals have liked on Facebook with interests included in individuals' "ad interests" from Facebook. 

As a dictionary, it could be used for a variety of purposes, but given the size (nearly 30,000 items) it would likely be better suited for comparing lists of accounts (e.g., on Twitter)  than for finding evidence of political talk within larger text files. 

## What's included 
This version of the dictionary includes: 

* Politics
	* The governor for every state 
	* All members of Congress
	* All state legislators 
	* The mayors of the 100 biggest cities in the U.S. 
	* Trump's cabinet (yes, this had to be updated many times)
	* Cabinet positions and major government departments 
* News
	* All journalists who report on politics and current events available in Meltwater's news search database 
	* All news organizations that report on politics and current events (e.g., not entertainment) available in Meltwater's news search database 
* Advocacy and activist organizations on the left and right of the political spectrum 
* Keywords related to news, current events, and politics 

This version was last updated March 2017. 

There is a more up to date version of the dictionary, but the March 2017 version reflects the dictionary we used for this data analysis.
